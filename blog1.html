          <h4>Website Critique</h4>


            <p>I was immediately drawn to this
              <a href="https://artsandculture.withgoogle.com" target="_blank">website</a>
            because of the images used,
            when I opened it in my browser and heard the music playing along with the video, I was hooked. The
            imagery is beautiful, with 360-degree shots, it feels like you’re there. However, in terms of design,
            the website doesn’t have much text at all, so not much hierarchy is established, which is something I
            would change. I wish the website had more blocks of text, including information about each National
            Park that the user could read in order to learn more about each place.
            </p>
            <p>The text that is present is white, which works well because there is so much color on the website due
            to the imagery. There are minimal buttons to click on the web page, so it is fairly easy to use and the
            home page button is clearly visible at the bottom of the website. Users are given the option to view each
            park side by side before deciding which one to click on, or they can view where each National Park is
            located on a map of the US. The website is meant to be explored, to spark interest in the National Parks.
            The design is successful for the purpose of this website, in my opinion.
