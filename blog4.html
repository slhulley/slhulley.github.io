          <h4>Responsive Website Critique: Flow Festival</h4>

            <p>I first observed the Flow Festival
              <a href="http://www.flowfestival.com/en/" target="_blank">website</a>
              in the desktop view and played around with resizing
              my browser window. I noticed that most things scaled down to size, except for the “Music” “Art”
              and “Talks” tabs in the Program section. The images start out centered within the section but as
              I made my browser smaller, the images became un-centered, until I reached a certain point, and then
              the images resized and became centered again. The same thing occurred in the tablet view. In this
              case, the website looks best in any of the mobile phone views. </p>

            <p>When I resized the site from desktop to mobile view I also noticed that the nav bar across the top
              becomes a hidden drop-down menu, which works well to make use of the small screen space on a mobile
              phone. The header of the website includes a slideshow of images that are overlaid with white text. The
              text is fairly readable in the desktop view; however, in mobile view, because the text is smaller, it
              becomes difficult to read over some of the images. So, I think the website looks best when viewed in
              the desktop view, where the readability is at its best.</p>

            <p>Although I don’t particularly like the color scheme of the website or the background images, I can
              see that they chose bright colors to appeal to the target audience, which would obviously be festival
              goers, who tend to be younger in age. </p>
