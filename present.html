      <p>In the last twenty years, most technological breakthroughs have been built around converting conventional
      analog information into digital information. “The digital camera is one of the most remarkable instances
      of this shift because it is so truly different from its predecessor. Conventional cameras depend entirely
      on chemical and mechanical processes—you don't even need electricity to operate them. On the other hand,
      all digital cameras have a built-in computer, and all of them record images electronically” (<a href="links.html">Nice</a>).
      Currently, millions of people own “professional grade” digital cameras because they have become accessible
      to the public; although, a lot of people opt for the more convenient smartphone camera. The smartphone
      now houses a camera that can capture photos with a high enough resolution to satisfy the everyday
      snapshot photographer. Those more serious about photography use digital cameras because they can record
      high-resolution images.
     </p>
     <p>Ourselves, loved ones, and the places we travel to seem to often be the subjects of most photographs. People
       have had portrait photos taken of themselves and their families for centuries, and as soon as more practical
       cameras were invented, people took them on trips to photograph those moments as well. Most people use photographs
       as a way to capture moments in time, and others treat photography as an art form, composing photographs based on the
       Gestalt principles of art and design.</p>
