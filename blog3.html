          <h4>A List Apart: "I Don't Like It" Article</h4>

            <p>This article caught my eye because I often worry about whether or not my boss, client or audience will like my work once I leave
              school and join the workforce, and what will happen if they don’t.  Reading this article eased my concerns a little bit, as Laura
              Kalbag discusses how to elicit more constructive feedback in order to create more valuable critiques.</p>

            <p> Kalbag begins the article stating that design isn’t just about aesthetics, and often times, a designer’s or client’s aesthetic
              preferences won’t benefit the particular design, and therefor it is important not to let aesthetics or taste get in the way of
              creating an effective design. It is also crucial not to lose focus of the best design for the intended audience, because you or
              your client or boss may not fit into the target audience. This is something that I often find myself struggling with, and can
              imagine myself struggling with in the future. It is best to understand that maybe while a design doesn’t necessarily appeal to my
              tastes, it’s ok as long as it works for the design as a whole.</p>

            <p>Kalbag mentions that encouraging open-ended critiques can be helpful in explaining why the client doesn’t like your work. I learned
              from this article that it is essential, as a designer, to ask the right questions in order for the client to give constructive
              criticism. If a client doesn’t like my work, I must break down the design into components to figure out which part of the design
              isn’t working for the client so we can both come up with a solution.</p>

            <p>I now understand how important it is to practice critiques in my classes here at UC Davis, because the more I practice, the more
              confident I will be about interacting with my clients or bosses in the future.</p>
