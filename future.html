      <p>It is likely that in the future the digital camera will continue to reduce in size and the smartphone will be able to
        house a better quality camera, so it is possible that the digital camera as we know it may even become obsolete. Rajiv
        Laroia, chief technology officer at Light, a camera start-up company, has created a prototype camera with optical zoom,
        wide-aperture lensing and DSLR-like sensor quality that is small enough to fit in your pocket. This L16 camera collects
        light from sixteen different lenses and sensors, five of these shoot at 35mm (equivalent to that of a standard smartphone)
        and the other eleven are 70mm-150mm and lie flat across the L16, allowing it to be flat and so small in size. Only zoom and
        shutter speed can be altered when taking the photograph, but photographers are able to alter the focus, depth-of-field, and
        exposure afterwards. The camera creates high-quality images, 52 megapixels to be exact (Letzter). This revolutionary technology
        has the ability to make high-resolution images available to the general public, with the ease of using a smartphone to take
        photographs.
